- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bismuth2
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in graphics programming and video game developement.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust.

- The larger projects I've worked on are not available publicly as they are still in active developement.
- My public game addons are over at my steam profile: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1533462174

- I can be reached at asterdev@yahoo.com
